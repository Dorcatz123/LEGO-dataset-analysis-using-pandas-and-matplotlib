### Here I am analysing the LEGO data set from the years 1949 till 2019 to figure out interesting trends in the dataset. This is a part of the project I did while doing the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/. Here I try to answer interesting questions such as how the complexity of LEGO sets have increased over the years, which LEGO theme has the highest number of pieces which one has the lowest etc.
